Summary - 

The Visualization gives you an idea of percentage of flights on time/delayed in US. based on the visualization there are about,
67% of flight arrive on time or being early, 
26% of flights are delayed less than 60 minutes,  
5.4%  of flights are delayed between 60 to 120 minutes,
1.3% flights are delayed more than 120 mintues.

Based on my analysis flight originated in San Diego Airport has the biggest delay of about 500 mins next to St.Louis which as about 366 mins delay. 
Majority of the delay is observed on flights originated from Chicago obviously because of one of the busiest airport in USA and the next place goes to Los Angeles.
The Majority of the flights are on time or early are the flights originated from Las Vegas Airport and the second place goes to Chicago.


Design - 

Chose to do a map since it will be a great learning opputunity and also when you think about flight location comes to mind. The map is circled with all the airports from USA and city names can be observed when you do a mouse over.
Added percentage to all the categories (ontime/Delayed),
Added colors to the buttons in accordance with the flight route,
Displayed the city names for the circles.
I chose to display 4 categories,
  • On time or arrived early - I chose Green color for arrived on time because this color usually referenced as normal.
  • delayed < 1 hr - I chose purple color for delayed flights < 1hr as less intense.
  • delayed > 1 hrs & < than 2 hrs - I chose brown to signify the intensity is building up.
  • delayed > 2 - I chose red color for delayed flights because this color usually referenced as warning


Feedback - 

Ritesh,
•	What do you notice in the visualization?
Hand hovering over the links missing
Color Legend - On time or arrived early – Color differentiation
Place names missing
Nice Transitioning of graphics, arrow would look better

•	What questions do you have about the data?
Static data, Source destination data, time zone data

•	What relationships do you notice?
Time zone relationship
Start time end time delay time relationship
Delay time calculation relationship with respect to time zone

•	What do you think is the main takeaway from this visualization?
Flight statistics Map shows country connectivity.
Most of the flights are on time or reach within 1-2 hours of delay
Most of the delays are within >1hr and < than 2 hours

•	Is there something you don’t understand in the graphic?
Place names, time zones , Color code


Ummar,
•	What do you notice in the visualization?
-	It shows well, but there is no clear way to understand the difference between the four categories:
•	On time or arrived early
•	delayed < 1 hr
•	delayed > 1 hrs & < than 2 hrs
•	delayed > 2

It would be good if the visualization can include numbers as well to help understand the summarized data.
•	What questions do you have about the data?
I would like to see the facts and numbers. Based on the visualization I cannot tell the difference between the four categories

•	What relationships do you notice?
I notice relationships between flights and cities that roll up to routes and travel plans

•	What do you think is the main takeaway from this visualization?
Flight connections between major US cities

•	Is there something you don’t understand in the graphic?
The data

Priya,

•	What do you notice in the visualization?
Flight routes b/w various US cities.

•	What questions do you have about the data?
what percent of the flights in each catrgory?

•	What relationships do you notice?
Major cities seems have more number of delays(eg.chicago)

•	What do you think is the main takeaway from this visualization?
Flight connections between major US cities

•	Is there something you don’t understand in the graphic?
would be nice to see time frame of the data.
