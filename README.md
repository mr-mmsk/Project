Ummar,
•	What do you notice in the visualization?
-	It shows well, but there is no clear way to understand the difference between the four categories:
•	On time or arrived early
•	delayed < 1 hr
•	delayed > 1 hrs & < than 2 hrs
•	delayed > 2

It would be good if the visualization can include numbers as well to help understand the summarized data.
•	What questions do you have about the data?
I would like to see the facts and numbers. Based on the visualization I cannot tell the difference between the four categories

•	What relationships do you notice?
I notice relationships between flights and cities that roll up to routes and travel plans

•	What do you think is the main takeaway from this visualization?
Flight connections between major US cities

•	Is there something you don’t understand in the graphic?
